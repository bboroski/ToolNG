# Academic Biology Domain Pack — 500 Terms

**Repository:** `ToolNG`  
**Dataset:** [`data/biology/academic_terms_500.tsv`](../data/biology/academic_terms_500.tsv)  
**Format:** UTF-8, pipe-delimited TSV, stable numeric IDs  
**Coverage:** 500 English terms with Russian equivalents across five biology domains

## Data contract

The file contains one header row and exactly 500 records. IDs are stable from 1 through 500 and must not be reassigned when translations or editorial notes are improved.

| Category key | IDs | Scope |
|---|---:|---|
| `molecular_cell` | 1–100 | Molecular and cell biology |
| `genetics_evolution` | 101–200 | Genetics, evolution, biotechnology and development |
| `ecology_environment` | 201–300 | Ecology and environmental biology |
| `physiology_anatomy` | 301–400 | Physiology and anatomy |
| `immunology_microbiology_virology` | 401–500 | Immunology, microbiology and virology |

Each record has four fields: `id`, `category`, `term_en`, and `term_ru`. The vertical bar is the field separator. Consumers should validate the header, record count, unique contiguous IDs, known category keys, UTF-8 decoding and non-empty terms before use.

## Editorial quality notes

The dataset preserves the 500-entry scope supplied for this project while normalizing clear spelling or translation issues:

- Entry 283, **Demecenter**, is retained to preserve the supplied sequence, but it is not a standard, unambiguous biology term and requires subject-matter review before use as an authoritative term.
- Entry 310 is normalized to **Nephron**; the supplied spelling was “Nefron”.
- Entry 461 is normalized to **Extremophile**; the supplied spelling was “Extremeophile”.
- Entry 487 is translated as **Эндемичное заболевание** to make the disease-context meaning explicit.

This is a bilingual study glossary, not a peer-reviewed ontology. Context-dependent terms can have other translations in specialist literature. Add synonyms or citations in a future version without silently changing stable IDs.

## Project-specific role

An optional offline vocabulary asset for future educational or evidence-labeling material. It is deliberately excluded from Windows PnP probing, backup-marker inspection, device readiness scoring and repair recommendations.

## Safety and integration boundaries

- Treat the glossary as passive text data. Never execute entries as code or commands.
- Do not infer health status, diagnose disease, recommend treatment, or make clinical decisions from a glossary match.
- Do not use terminology as a substitute for biosafety procedures, laboratory protocols, calibrated measurements or professional review.
- Keep this pack optional and offline. Core system, boot, manufacturing, device-diagnostic and lifecycle behavior must remain independent of it.
- Any future parser or UI must handle unknown terms gracefully and retain the original source entry for traceability.

## Change policy

Keep all nine repository copies byte-for-byte aligned when updating the shared pack. Review changes to scientific wording separately from software changes. Validate exactly 500 data rows and IDs 1–500 after every update.
