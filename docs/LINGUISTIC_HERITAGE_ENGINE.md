# Linguistic Heritage Engine: Cyrillic Ы

**Status:** research data contract and repository integration baseline  
**Shared record:** `data/linguistic-heritage/cyrillic-letter-y.json`  
**Contract:** `linguistic-heritage.letter.v1`

## Purpose

This repository participates in the 13-repository Linguistic Heritage Engine. The shared subject is the Cyrillic grapheme **Ы / ы**, researched through separate but connected layers: graphic genealogy, historical phonology, modern articulation, comparative Slavic phonetics, orthographic history and cultural interpretation.

## Repository integration role

Read-only evidence consumer: may inspect local text/script metadata and report Unicode normalization or encoding anomalies; it must not alter user files or claim linguistic interpretation.

The integration is intentionally scoped to this repository's existing responsibility. The shared research record is reference data, not a new runtime dependency. No repository's product behavior, device access, boot path, firmware, lifecycle or safety policy is changed by the presence of this record.

## Research rules

1. Keep grapheme history distinct from the history of the sound [ɨ].
2. Treat ЪІ / ЪИ as the conventional ligature explanation; do not invent a single creation date.
3. Mark disputed phonological analyses as disputed.
4. Do not equate Russian ы, Polish y and Ukrainian и as identical phones.
5. Keep symbolism and numerology in an explicitly interpretive layer.
6. Every manuscript-specific statement requires a verifiable shelfmark, folio and specialist source.
7. Distinguish documented evidence, scholarly interpretation and open hypothesis.

## Validation

The JSON record is designed for deterministic, offline validation. The shared conformance test uses only the Python standard library:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_linguistic_heritage_contract.py' -v
```

This test validates the local research record's structural and epistemic guardrails. It does not prove historical truth or replace expert review.

## Cross-repository boundaries

- SAMBU owns the canonical data contract, schema and research validator.
- Luci may inspect the metadata and report policy violations; it does not certify scholarship.
- Klipot may present a read-only research view; it does not execute repository code.
- Hellduck indexes repository participation and versioned relationships.
- All other repositories expose a scoped reference/integration note without acquiring runtime dependencies.
