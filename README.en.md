> **ToolNG** — ToolNG is a local, read-only Windows diagnostic utility that separates confirmed device signals from unknown state and incomplete evidence coverage.

## Current capabilities
- Observe Windows PnP/USB devices and related services.
- Read-only inspection of local backup markers and connection events.
- Local reports, logs, exports and sensitive-field redaction.
- Explainable readiness and evidence-coverage reporting.

## Quick start and verification
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
python one.py check
```

## Architecture and verified scope
ToolNG does not repair devices, modify drivers or services, inspect private backup contents or upload diagnostics. A recommendation is not an executed action.

## Engineering quality
- Run the checks appropriate to the target platform; host CI is not hardware qualification.
- Mark capabilities as implemented, partial or planned according to code, tests and evidence.
- A mockup, specification or open pull request is not proof of a production-ready feature.
- External integrations must be explicit, versioned, isolated and testable.

Each repository retains its canonical name, code, APIs, release lifecycle and ownership boundaries. Integration means versioned contracts, not automatic merging of independent runtimes.

## Design and documentation
The shared interface direction is **Duck Black / Yellow**: dark surfaces, yellow accents for actions and state, readable typography, accessible contrast, keyboard navigation and reduced-motion support. See [design/DUCK_UI_SYSTEM.md](design/DUCK_UI_SYSTEM.md) when present.

## Visual identity
The Duck visual baseline uses structural black `#0D0D0D` (with `#111111` retained for legacy dark surfaces) and signal yellow `#FFD600`. Yellow marks primary actions, focus, selection and progress; status is never communicated by color alone.
